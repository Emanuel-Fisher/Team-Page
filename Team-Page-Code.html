        <p>Eminem</p>
        <p>He's definielty a good rapper. I wouldn't use all his cussing as he does too much of it, but the way he can rap so fast and still be coherent is amazing and will be of great help.</p>

        <p>Great team and i like their usage of bass tones but also their productions(as well as NF's) is very good. I would like to incorperate that in my music.</p>
